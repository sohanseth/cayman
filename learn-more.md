title: Data to Discovery

We often see data as just characters on our computer screen.  However, each character has a story to tell: an ingenious machine that breaks the genome down in pieces and reads its sequence; an amazing person who fights incurable disease and volunteers for case studies; and a visionary who spends a lifetime looking at these data to find hidden patterns and meaning. In this seminar series, we will learn about data from different fields of science: how they are collected - the technology and the human efforts behind it - and how they contribute to better understanding the world around us.

We will hear from experts in their respective fields of study, and learn about,

- **what field of science do they work on** (e.g., gene therapy or earthquake modelling)

- **what is the nature of data associated with it** (e.g., tabular, text, images, time series, networks, structured/non-structured, big/small, readily available/very rare etc.),

- **where does the data come from** (e.g., the data might come from a global effort in understanding a socio-economic issue, or it might come from a patient in critical care),

- **how is the data collected** (e.g., data collection often uses cutting edge techniques such as sequencing the human genome, or observing a material in extreme conditions)

- **how is the data processed and analyzed** (e.g., it might involve simple statistical tools with careful prior choices or state-of-the-art machine learning on big data)

- **what has been done with this kind of data** (e.g., the questions that have been answered so far, such as the functionality of a gene, or the responsiveness of a drug) 

- **what are the open/ground-breaking questions that need answering** (e.g., what is the respective field of study trying to achieve as a community)

- **whether the data is publicly available** (e.g., if the data and/or similar data are easily available, if so then where and how one can access it, and if not then what is the alternative)
